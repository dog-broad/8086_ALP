# 8086 Assembly Language Examples

I created this repository to document some of my practice code for the 8086 Assembly Language. The code is meant to be used as an example for others who are learning the 8086 Assembly Language.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you can clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dog-broad/8086_ALP.git
```

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need an assembler and a linker. You can use any assembler and linker that supports the 8086 Assembly Language.
I personally suggest using the Emu8086 - Microprocessor Emulator.
